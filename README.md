# Music-Room-

This project will be like zoom but instead of video chatting a person will create a room and play music and people can join and hear music or they can give feedback to your music, like give a thums up or down or suggest to skipp the song.
The host will also be able to make it private room and can give a code to people that can join in and also the host can give them permision to control the music etc. It will use a third party api like spotify or pandora. It will also have a login and signup page.
